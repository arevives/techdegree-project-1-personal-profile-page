        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My career goal is to become a remote Software Engineer specializing in E-Commerce websites, and to work as an independent contractor.</p>
        <p>I've worked in varied jobs ranging from being a part of the Speech Pathology team and as an Assistive Technology Specialist.
        From helping to pick grapes with my grandmother to working in customer service in the food industry business, being a full-time mommy 
        is the best job I have ever had in my entire life.</p>
        <p>Being a SAHM is a beautiful and loving sacrifice. Each day with my baby reminds me of the scarcity of time, and the beautiful and challenging 
        moments that fill each day. I am trusting that this career change will provide for my family that will allow us to be financially stable, be physically 
        and emotionally present for whenever they need me.</p>
